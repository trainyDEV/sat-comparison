# SAT Comparison: Python Implementations of DPLL, DP, and Resolution Algorithms

This project provides Python implementations of three SAT (Boolean Satisfiability Problem) solving algorithms:

- **DP (Davis–Putnam)**
- **DPLL (Davis–Putnam–Logemann–Loveland)**
- **Resolution-based Solving**

---

## Repository Contents

- `solver.py`: Main script implementing the SAT solvers.
- `Sat 20 AVG.txt`: Time performance results from 20 runs, used in the research paper.
- `README.md`: Project documentation (this file).

---

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher.
- No external libraries are required.

## 🛠 Customizing Inputs
To test your own CNF formulas:

1. Prepare your CNF input (as a list of clauses).

2. Modify solver.py to load and process your CNF input.

3. Run the script.
