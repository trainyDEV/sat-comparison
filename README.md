# SAT Comparison: Python Implementations of DPLL, DP, and Resolution Algorithms



This Repository was made in order to distribute the code used and results for my SAT paper.

SAT Algorithms used include **DP, DPLL and Resolution.**

Included in the repository is the code used and 20 test runs that made up the average in my research paper.
